                     Holy shit. The new Snapchat update is killing it… and us! Here are the YAYs and NAYs from Snapchat update.

                                        If it’s letters, and not a meme or Humans of New York, my eyes basically do not accept them. If Facebook comes up with a new update, instead of appreciating it, I roll my eyes and say ‘what again!!!’. If an image has more than 5 lines of content, I scroll down. Basically I have no shits to give. The most effort I put is probably into stalking. Yes, I am part of the lethargic generation of social-but-not-so-social-beings. I like things served to me on a plate. I like doing nothing.

                                        	So today came to me as a shock. I wasn’t ready for, what was basically a reinvented Snapchat. All I wanted to do was stalk some, and show some. But then again, change is the only constant. There are plenty of new features. I wonder if my lethargic folks are ready for this much pressure yet. Here are a few of the new features and my take on the YAYs and NAYs:
                                    </p>

                                        &Diamond; <b>Stickers:</b> We all saw this coming. Snapchat acquired Bitstrips and we now know why. Stickers are very common and almost all chat apps have their unique relatable stickers. Also these stickers will automatically be inserted relating to the text you type (similar to Whatsapp on Nokia Lumia). I like this feature because stickers are always fun, and what’s better than a dancing emoji of a koala bear?

                                    <p>
                                        &Diamond;<b>Story auto-advancing:</b> This feature is what disappointed me the most. Snapchat is not so exclusive anymore and people end up having hundreds on their list. But it’s not necessary that the person would be interested in knowing what’s happening in each of their lives. I have always liked the choice of clicking on whoever I want and just checking on them. But now I will also end up watching some random story I am not interested in. This update has been introduced to boost people’s ‘posting’ morales. But hey, if I don’t want to see it, I do not freaking want to see it!

                                        &Diamond;<b>Video/Audio calling:</b> Further to add to the misery of telecom companies who are already taking the hit from apps like Skype, Viber, Whatsapp, Snapchat has started its video and audio calling feature. Snapchat is aiming to be something of a ‘SnapPhone’. 
                                    
                                    </p>

                                        &Diamond;<b>Video Notes:</b> Now one can send up to 10 second long video notes which play on loop on the receivers end. The receiver can listen to the audio by clicking for it while playing the video. That’s a good move because such audios can be disastrous and the most absurd (Snapchatters can expect plenty of It). So basically it’s like a human GIF reaction for chats.

                                    Other new features include audio notes; sending multiple photos at a time; sharing photos from camera roll during video and audio calls; transmitting between video/audio calls, video/audio notes, stickers and text.

                                    I love that Snapchat is taking the next step towards making human interaction feel more real. The features are very easy to use and surely add value to the app. However the heaviness of the app has always been my concern. It is the heaviest app among its competitors and in countries like ours (India) where bandwidth is quite low, I wonder how these additions will affect the usability. As of now I have uninstalled the app because I was in a shock in the morning. But I know installing it back will be the first thing I will do tomorrow morning.
