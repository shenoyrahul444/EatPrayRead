										A lot has been written about technology. Some call it a ‘time-consuming distraction’ from life’s important

tasks. Others say it’s just a waste of time. But technology can actually make you better at what you do if

you use it well. For instance, you can plan your tasks and set reminders for them. At Quikchex, we are

always looking for new ways to make ourselves productive at work, and here are 7 Apps that we think will

help you be more efficient:

										These are 8 must have Apps for a more productive day –
									</p>

									1.	<b>Inkflow –</b>
Inkflow is an app for the frequent brainstormers out there. If you’re the one who gets ideas when

you are on your way back home or when you are at a restaurant with no pen or paper in sight,

then this one’s for you. Inkflow helps you note things down or even re-imagine your ideas in a

visual manner by sketching and drawing. You also create PDFs of the same and share with your

										2. <b>Focus Booster</b>
									The biggest problem with us procrastinators, is that we use our phones as medium of distraction.

We are distracted from work by a WhatsApp message. We trick our minds into the ‘what ifs’.

What if the message is important? What if I reply too late? All this, even when we know that isn’t

the case most of the times. The Focus Booster app helps you focus on your task, by locking your

phone whenever you want to and for whatever time period. The Focus Booster helps maintain

sustainable and long term productivity.
<br>
Ps. It’s ‘Technology against technology’.. FTW!

										3. <b>Tomighty - </b>

Tomighty like Focus Booster is a desktop timer and that alternates between 25 minutes of work

and 5 to 10 minutes of breaks for better productivity. It’s similar to the Focus Booster app, except

that Tomighty is a desktop timer and is available on MAC &amp; Windows.

										4. <b>InstaPaper –</b>

The Internet is filled with good reads. There’s a great amount of content out there waiting to be

read when you are at work, because procrastinating is human. You convince yourself if you don’t

read the article right away you will lose them in your newsfeed among the various pictures your

friends have posted. Instapaper is the best app for this kind of procrastination. It saves articles or

blog posts to your account which can be read later, at a convenient time. Your Instapaper account

can also be synced to all your devices so that you can read the saved articles on any device.

										5. <b>Inshorts - </b> 

Inshorts is the reason why they say ‘the age of the newspapers has passed’. People these days

prefer get instant news, which they can read on their smartphones. But more than convenience,

they now want news that is short, precise and free of personal opinions (Unlike many Indian

Newspapers). Inshorts delivers news in less than 60 words with only essential facts and free of

any kind of storytelling. If those sixty words interest the reader, it also provides the option to

expand individual stories and read the entire article from the source (such as Business Standard

etc.)
