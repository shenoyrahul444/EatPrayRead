                                          If you operate two or more Instagram accounts, you know how much of a pain that can be. Entering the username and password in that tiny little area without the option of auto insert.
                                         Nightmares of having posted the wrong content in the wrong account. Not allowing third parties to post on the app. The search history being swept away once logged out. And the app-only model only making it tougher. There are many many many things I can rant about all day. But that’s all about to come to an end. There’s good news!

                                        Instagram has introduced a new feature. One can now add and switch between accounts on the app, without having to log out. Whaaaaat! This seems like a dream come true for me, since I have to switch between many accounts on a daily basis, which sure as hell is tiring. So now I can add up to five accounts and switch without any hassles of logging out. This is a feature that was a necessity, considering the number of companies using Instagram as one of the main channels for marketing. The twitter app always had this feature which made it really smooth to use. It is also why response time for companies had reduced. With this update on Instagram, we can look forward to SMEs having more content and engagement on Instagram. Not just that, the app looks much more user friendly and will attract activity from bloggers. Many bloggers have a blog account and a personal account, so this is something they can look forward to. In all, this is a great update and I look forward to using it to explore of #Instagram
