                                        In order to achieve goals and planned results within a defined schedule and a budget, a manager uses a project management methodology.
                                        Regardless of which field or which trade, there are assortments of methodologies to help managers at every stage 
                                        of a project from the initiation to implementation to the closure.

                                        The waterfall model is a sequential design process, used in software development processes, in which progress is 
                                        seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall).

                                        This methodology divides the project management process into 7 consecutive phases: <br>

                                    The waterfall methodology is frequently used in the work domains where outputs are physical objects 
                                    as the whole process is a sequence and the process cannot move forward unless the previous stage is
                                    completed. The sequence of the stages needs to followed for the successful completion of the projects.
                                    Although it looks very clean and suits the requirements in domains with simple chain of work process,
                                    practically the waterfall methodology is not adaptable.  Due to its structured approach, scope changes are
                                    very slow, which makes it unsuitable for projects where the client is not sure about what he or she wants. 
                                    It is generally estimated that it takes about 20-40% of the total time allotted to the project is invested in
                                    the first 2 stages. Hence, when it comes to adaptability and speed, this traditional waterfall methodology lags behind.

                                    <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        To overcome the drawbacks of the waterfall approach, the agile methodology is used. It is an incremental and iterative project 
                                        management methodology in which the project lifecycle and the features of the end product are not clearly defined at the 
                                        starting of the project. Instead of that, the work is carried out through a few iterative phases called "sprints". Each
                                        sprint is composed of many tasks and has a small part of the end product as its output. Agile project management allows project
                                        managers to constantly gather feedback and refine the requirements between two iterations.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        
                                        When using this methodology, project responsibilities are divided among three roles : <br>
                                        1>	The product owner<br>
                                        2>	Scrum Master<br>
                                        3>	Team Members<br>
                                    
                                    The <b>product owner </b>sets the product goals, handles the tradeoff of schedule versus scope, adapting to changing project requirements and setting 
                                    priorities for product features. <br>
                                    
                                    The <b>scrum master </b>takes care of the prioritization of tasks and makes sure the impediments are removed from the work process.<br>
                                    The <b> team members </b>handle the tasks, managing the daily work details and preparing progress reports. They are also required to control the quality of the products which involves continuous testing. <br>
                                        </p>
                                        The agile development methodology is the best approach for projects with unpredictable changes in the scope, and are widely used in the areas of software development and designing. However, when the scope are limited and well defined, it is always better to make use of the traditional project management methodology which involves proper documentation, well defined scope, and more predictability of the scope.<br>

                                    <h2>Rapid Application Development (RAD)</h2>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                    Rapid application development is a project management methodology often used in software development where the main goal is to develop 
                                    applications faster and with high quality. It divides the project management process into four phases:    <br>
                                    1>	Requirements planning<br>
                                    2>	User design<br>
                                    3>	Rapid construction<br>
                                    4>	Transition<br>
                                    Rapid application development can improve quality of the deliverables and risk management. On the other hand, it is not suitable for large software projects, may lead to poor code quality and requires the client to be involved in project execution all the time.

                                    <h2>Critical chain / path</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        As opposed to waterfall and agile project management, that focus more on schedules and tasks, the critical chain project management methodology 
                                        is geared more towards solving resource problems. Each project has a certain set of core elements, called a critical chain (sometimes referred as
                                        critical path), that establish a project’s minimum timeline. The critical chain methodology devotes adequate resources to this critical chain while 
                                        devoting enough resources to other tasks such that they can run concurrently, but still have enough of a buffer to reassign resources when needed. 
                                        This setup is ideal for resource-heavy teams, or for those who have enough flexibility in their team members’ respective skill sets.

                                    <p>
                                        Projects integrating Sustainable Methods (PRiSM) was developed by GPM Global as a means of creating a methodology that took environmental factors into
                                        account while being a repeatable, efficient process that could easily be incorporated into various large-scale projects. PRiSM is unique in that it is 
                                        one of the few project management methodologies that requires and rewards project managers with accreditation. PRiSM is used primarily for large-scale 
                                        real estate development or construction/infrastructure projects that may result in adverse environmental effects.

                                    <h2>PRINCE2</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        PRINCE2 is a government-endorsed project management methodology, released and supported by the UK government in 1996. It is a very process-oriented methodology, dividing projects into multiple stages, each with their own plans and processes to follow. 
                                        Like PRiSM, PRINCE2 requires accreditation via exams. PRINCE2 is a complicated yet thorough methodology, but the project manager needs to determine whether or not it will scale properly with their specific requirements.<br>
                                        PRINCE stands for Projects in Controlled Environments. It is very commonly used project management method in all parts of the world and has proven to be highly effective in various respects.<br>
                                        The method also helps you to identify and thereafter assign roles to the different members of the team based on expertise. Over the years, there have been a number of positive case studies of projects that have used PRINCE2 project management methodology. 
                                        This method deals with the various aspects that need to be managed in any given project.

                                We have seen the various project management methodologies and understood how they are different from each other. The question that arises at this point is normally, “Which is the best one?”

                                    <p>
                                        The simple answer is that no methodology can fit all purposes. There will always be debaters on which methodology is more effective and which has the best track method.
