                                          The encryption service will encrypt all messages, phone calls, photos, and videos moving among them.
                                          And that’s true on any phone that runs the app, from iPhones to Android phones to Windows phones to old school Nokia flip phones.
                                          With end-to-end encryption in place, not even WhatsApp’s employees can read the data that’s sent across its network

                                        WhatsApp, which is owned by tech giant Facebook, has grown into one of the world’s most important applications, 
                                        where more than a billion people trade messages, make phone calls, send photos, and swap videos on a daily basis. The credit for this remarkable advancement undoubtedly goes to the founders of WhatsApp, Brian Acton and Jan Koum. But the real hero behind this advancement is the high-minded enigmatic coder and cryptographer, who goes by the pseudonym Moxie Marlinspike.

                                        In tech security and privacy circles, Marlinspike is a well-known idealist.
                                        But the stance he has taken alongside Acton and Koum—not to mention the other WhatsApp engineers who worked on the project and the braintrust at Facebook that’s backing the effort—is hardly extreme in the context of Silicon Valley’s wider clash with governments and law enforcement over privacy. 
                                        In Silicon Valley, strong encryption isn’t really up for debate. Among tech’s most powerful leaders, it’s orthodoxy. And WhatsApp is encryption’s latest champion.
                                        It sees itself as fighting the same fight as Apple and so many others.

    					 WhatsApp uses what’s called public key encryption: To send a message to User B, User A asks a WhatsApp server for a public key that applies to User B. User A then uses the public key to encrypt the message. User B’s private key—only available on User B’s phone—decrypts the message.
                                    
                                    <h3>How this going to effect the current debate involving Apple and the FBI </h3>
                                    <p>
                                         The new advancement by WhatsApp is said to have left the Apple Vs FBI debate over encryption into dust. Apple encrypts the data sitting on an iPhone, and it uses end-to-end encryption to hide the messages that travel over its own iMessage texting service. But iMessage is only available on iPhones. Over the years, Apple has sold about 800 million iPhones. But it’s hard to know how many are still in use, or how many people who have them are communicating via iMessage anyway. WhatsApp runs on just about every kind of phone. Plus, Apple’s techniques have some gaping holes. Most notably, many users back up their iMessages to Apple’s iCloud service, which negates the end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp, meanwhile, has a billion users on its service right now.

                                        What makes this move even more striking is that the company did this with such a tiny group of people. The company employs only about 50 engineers. And it took a team of only 15 of them to bring encryption to the company’s one billion users—a tiny, technologically empowered group of individuals engaging in a new form of asymmetrical resistance to authority, standing up not only to the US government, but all governments.

                                        The founders believe that online privacy must be protected against surveillance of all kinds, and now the government has to contend with something much bigger than a locked iPhone: secrecy for a billion people.
                                        Like Apple, WhatsApp is, in practice, stonewalling the federal government, but it’s doing so on a larger front—one that spans roughly a billion devices.  Acton says. Technology is an amplifier. With the right stewards in place, with the right guidance, we can really effect positive change.”

                                        Many lawmakers have called for companies like WhatsApp to equip their encryption schemes with a backdoor available only to law enforcement. There’s even been talk of a law that requires these backdoors. But as Koum sees it, slipping a backdoor into an encrypted service would defeat the purpose: you might as well not encrypt it at all. A backdoor would just open the service to abuse by both government and hackers. Besides, if you did add a backdoor, or remove encryption from WhatsApp entirely, that wouldn’t stop bad actors. They’d just go elsewhere. In the age of open source software, encryption tools are freely available to everyone.
