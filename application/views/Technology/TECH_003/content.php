                                            Over the years we have heard about this term called 'Big data' and we wonder what it exactly is. 
                                            Is it something new that we should all be worried about? How is it different from data? 
                                            Why is it so important and such a big deal these days? What does it stand for 
                                            and who are the people who work with this 'Big Data'. I am here to answer all your doubts about 
                                            this buzzword.

                                        I have heard big data defined in many, many different ways, and so, I’m not surprised there’s so much 
                                        confusion surrounding the term. So to clear all your doubts, I would like to start by providing a basic 
                                        definition for it. So Big data is basically a collection of data from traditional and digital sources 
                                        inside and outside your company that represents a source for ongoing discovery and analysis.
                                    </p> 
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Some people like to constrain big data to digital inputs like web behavior and social network interactions; 
                                        however we can’t exclude traditional data derived from product transaction information, financial records and
                                        interaction channels, such as the call center and point-of-sale. All of that is big data, too, even though it
                                        may be dwarfed by the volume of digital data that’s now growing at an exponential rate.

                                    In defining big data, it’s also important to understand the mix of unstructured and multi-structured data that comprises
                                    the volume of information. Unstructured data comes from information that is not organized or easily interpreted by 
                                    traditional databases or data models, and typically, it’s text-heavy. Metadata, Twitter tweets, and other social 
                                    media posts are good examples of unstructured data.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Multi-structured data refers to a variety of data formats and types and can be derived from interactions between people 
                                        and machines, such as web applications or social networks. A great example is web log data, which includes a combination
                                        of text and visual images along with structured data like form or transactional information.  As digital disruption 
                                        transforms communication and interaction channels—and as marketers enhance the customer experience across devices, 
                                        web properties, face-to-face interactions and social platforms—multi-structured data will continue to evolve.

                                        Industry leaders like the global analyst firm Gartner use phrases like “volume” (the amount of data), “velocity”
                                        (the speed of information generated and flowing into the enterprise) and “variety” (the kind of data available)
                                        to begin to frame the big data discussion. Others have focused on additional V’s, such as big data’s “veracity” 
                                        and “value.”
                                    </p>

                                        One thing is clear: Every enterprise needs to fully understand big data – what it is to them, what is does for them, 
                                        what it means to them –and the potential of data-driven marketing, starting today. Don’t wait. Waiting will only delay
                                        the inevitable and make it even more difficult to unravel the confusion.
                                        
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Once you start tackling big data, you’ll learn what you don’t know, and you’ll be inspired to take steps to resolve any problems. 
                                    Best of all, you can use the insights you gather at each step along the way to start improving your customer engagement strategies;
                                    that way, you’ll put big data marketing to work and immediately add more value to both your offline and online interactions.
