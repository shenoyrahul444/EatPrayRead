                                        We have all had times where we like certain features of one mobile brand but we wish it had certain features of another mobile brand. For example, 
                                        one brand offers you high processing speed but comes with a low resolution camera, second brand offers you a good camera but limited memory storage
                                        , the third provides upgradable memory storage but no front camera, the fourth has all the shortcomings but is waterproof. What we get in the 
                                        market are pre-assembled combination of features without the ability to get everything we want in the ideal phone for us. The manufacturers fool the customers 
                                        by adding small features into their otherwise similar products and selling them as completely different models. We are also used to this concept of pre-assembled 
                                        mobiles and hence, we settle down for the brand which provides the features that satisfies our high priority requirements and try not to get disappointed about 
                                        whatever feature we couldn’t get. This is the story of every mobile purchaser and I know it for sure. Does it have to be this way? Why cant we be deciding what we 
                                        want instead of the manufacturers? Is there a way we can change this imperfect system?

                                        	This is where the Google’s Project Ara comes into picture. Project Ara brings to us the concept of modular phones, where we see a mobile phone as a combination
                                                of pieces of hardware that can be customized to build the ideal mobile. You decide what you want and what you don’t want. Isn’t that great? Don’t you feel powerful 
                                                already? When your speaker or screen gets damaged, you don’t buy a new phone or get it repaired, you just replace the damaged part with the new part. How amazing is 
                                                that? Imagine companies that sell only mobile speakers, only mobile screens, only bluetooth modules, only keypads. We could select which brand we want for which purpose
                                                . For example, I want a Sony camera, but Bose speakers,a Snapdragon processor, San-Disk storage, and Apple's body. This is exactly like assembling a Personal computer. The whole 
                                                system of mobile manufacturing changes when we bring modularity into picture. This is what Project Ara aims to offer.

                                    Project Ara lives in Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group. Project Ara smartphone is scheduled to begin pilot testing in the United States in 2016 with a target bill of materials
                                    cost of $50 for a basic grey phone. Google aims to lower the entry barrier for the hardware manufacturing companies to start building modules for Ara smartphones, so that even the small companies 
                                    can participate in the concept and provide more varieties options instead of being dominated by only handful of big companies like in today’s scenario.

                                    Google says the device is designed to be utilized by "6 billion people"; including 1 billion current smartphone users, 5 billion feature phone users, and 1 billion future users not currently connected. 
                                    The Ara phones would run the Android operating system although the program is more of a development effort and is not an official Android or Nexus product.

                                    The core Project Ara team at Google consists of three people with most of the work being done by outside contractors. One of the main contractors is NK Labs, a Massachusetts-based engineering firm, whose co-founder is Ara Knaian after whom the project was named.

                                    Potential issues with the modular concept include a tradeoff between volumetric efficiency and modularity, as the framework interface holding the device would increase overall size and weight. But provided the flexibility that the consumers will have to
                                    assemble their mobile phones, I believe this is a good start for project Ara. One thing I know for sure is that Ara Phone is the future of Mobile phones and although the concept may be questioned at the points of feasibility and form factor, I am sure the 
                                    people at Google are smart enough to come up with solutions and make the Ara phone a reality of the near future.
